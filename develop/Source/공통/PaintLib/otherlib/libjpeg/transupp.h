LEGAL ISSUES
============

In plain English:

1. We don't promise that this software works. (But if you find any bugs,
please let us know!)
2. You can use this software for whatever you want. You don't have to pay us.
3. You may not pretend that you wrote this software. If you use it in a
program, you must acknowledge somewhere in your documentation that
you've used the IJG code.

In legalese:

The authors make NO WARRANTY or representation, either express or implied,
with respect to this software, its quality, accuracy, merchantability, or
fitness for a particular purpose. This software is provided "AS IS", and you,
its user, assume the entire risk as to its quality and accuracy.

All Rights Reserved except as specified below.

Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this
software (or portions thereof) for any purpose, without fee, subject to these
conditions:
(1) If any part of the source code for this software is distributed, then this
README file must be included, with this copyright and no-warranty notice
unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the original files
must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation.
(2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying
documentation must state that "this software is based in part on the work of
the Independent JPEG Group".
(3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts
full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept
NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind.

These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code,
not just to the unmodified library. If you use our work, you ought to
acknowledge us.

Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or company name
in advertising or publicity relating to this software or products derived from
it. This software may be referred to only as "the Independent JPEG Group's

We specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the basis of
commercial products, provided that all warranty or liability claims are

ansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of L. Peter Deutsch,
sole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA.
ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and conditions, but instead
by the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally,
that you must include source code if you redistribute it. (See the file
ansi2knr.c for full details.) However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed as part
of any program generated from the IJG code, this does not limit you more than
the foregoing paragraphs do.

The Unix configuration script "configure" was produced with GNU Autoconf.
It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable.
The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub,
ltconfig, ltmain.sh). Another support script, install-sh, is copyright
by M.I.T. but is also freely distributable.

It appears that the arithmetic coding option of the JPEG spec is covered by
patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi. Hence arithmetic coding cannot
legally be used without obtaining one or more licenses. For this reason,
support for arithmetic coding has been removed from the free JPEG software.
(Since arithmetic coding provides only a marginal gain over the unpatented
Huffman mode, it is unlikely that very many implementations will support it.)
So far as we are aware, there are no patent restrictions on the remaining
code.

The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files.
To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support has
been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to produce
"uncompressed GIFs". This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the
resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all standard
GIF decoders.

/*
 * Although rotating and flipping data expressed as DCT coefficients is not
 * hard, there is an asymmetry in the JPEG format specification for images
 * whose dimensions aren't multiples of the iMCU size.  The right and bottom
 * image edges are padded out to the next iMCU boundary with junk data; but
 * no padding is possible at the top and left edges.  If we were to flip
 * the whole image including the pad data, then pad garbage would become
 * visible at the top and/or left, and real pixels would disappear into the
 * pad margins --- perhaps permanently, since encoders & decoders may not
 * bother to preserve DCT blocks that appear to be completely outside the
 * nominal image area.  So, we have to exclude any partial iMCUs from the
 * basic transformation.
 *
 * Transpose is the only transformation that can handle partial iMCUs at the
 * right and bottom edges completely cleanly.  flip_h can flip partial iMCUs
 * at the bottom, but leaves any partial iMCUs at the right edge untouched.
 * Similarly flip_v leaves any partial iMCUs at the bottom edge untouched.
 * The other transforms are defined as combinations of these basic transforms
 * and process edge blocks in a way that preserves the equivalence.
 *
 * The "trim" option causes untransformable partial iMCUs to be dropped;
 * this is not strictly lossless, but it usually gives the best-looking
 * result for odd-size images.  Note that when this option is active,
 * the expected mathematical equivalences between the transforms may not hold.
 * (For example, -rot 270 -trim trims only the bottom edge, but -rot 90 -trim
 * followed by -rot 180 -trim trims both edges.)
 *
 * We also offer a "force to grayscale" option, which simply discards the
 * chrominance channels of a YCbCr image.  This is lossless in the sense that
 * the luminance channel is preserved exactly.  It's not the same kind of
 * thing as the rotate/flip transformations, but it's convenient to handle it
 * as part of this package, mainly because the transformation routines have to
 * be aware of the option to know how many components to work on.
